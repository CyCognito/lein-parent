# lein-parent

A Leiningen plugin for inheriting properties from a parent project.

This plugin is useful when you have a series of related projects that all share
some set of properties and want to avoid duplicating the values across
projects. e.g. you have several projects that all share the same Maven private
repository information.

lein-parent is the conceptual reverse of
[lein-sub](https://github.com/kumarshantanu/lein-sub).

## Usage

Put `[lein-parent "0.3.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

Specify a parent in your project.clj and which properties to inherit from it as
follows.

    :parent-project {:path "../project.clj"
                     :inherit [:dependencies :repositories [:profiles :dev]]
                     :only-deps [org.clojure/clojure com.stuartsierra/component]}

Inherited properties may be either keywords or sequences of
keywords. These values are used to select which properties from your
parent to merge into your project. To select only specific
dependencies, specify the first part of the dependency atoms in a
sequence with :only-deps.  To see the actual values of these
properties, run:

    $ lein parent
